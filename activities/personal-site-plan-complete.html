            <hr />

            <p>This week along with finishing up the Dry Oar site, we need to finish up the planning for our personal
                site.</p>


            <h2>Website Requirements</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>The Web site must consist of a home page and at least two child pages</li>
                <li>One of the child pages should incorporate a form.</li>
                <li>The Web site must be hosted on the web.</li>
                <li>Each page of your Web site must satisfy the following requirements:
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            <strong>
                                <em>Significant textual content</em>
                            </strong>consisting of appropriate content for your audience so that they can understand
                            the meaning and
                            message of this site</li>
                        <li>
                            <em>At least</em> one image that relates to the content of the page</li>
                        <li>Working links to your two child pages</li>
                        <li>Be laid out and styled according to your site plan.</li>
                        <li>Be visually appealing and easily readable</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>

            </ol>
            <h2>Activity Directions</h2>
            <ol class="bigSteps">
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Create the Home wireframe</h3>
                    <p>Make sure that you have completed the <a href="personal-site-plan.html" target="_blank">Personal
                            Site Plan part 1</a> and <a href="personal-site-content.html" target="_blank">Personal Site
                            Plan part 2: content</a> activities. If you have completed those; all that you should have
                        left to
                        complete your site plan is to
                        create wireframes for the three pages. Review the content you prepared last week for each page that
                        you are planning to build, then start with the Home page. Make sure you account for each block
                        of content in your plan. Pay special attention to the header and footer as these should be on
                        each page. Keep in mind as well the <a href="../resources/design-principles.html" target="_blank">principles
                            of good design</a>.</p>

                </li>
                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Create the other wireframes</h3>
                    <p>Using your Home wireframe as a starting point (remember that the header and footer should be the
                        same across all three pages) create wireframes for your two child pages. Add all three
                        wireframes to the Site plan.</p>

                    <!-- END STEP  -->
                </li>

                <li>
                    <!-- START STEP -->
                    <h3>Verify</h3>
                    <p>Review each section of your site plan. Make sure that each is complete and free of spelling and
                        grammar errors. Then publish and submit the URL of your plan to I-Learn.</p>

                    <!-- END STEP  -->
